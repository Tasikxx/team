<p>The site was divided into equal parts and distributed among members. Repository was established on page of teamlead. All memvers  do  fork and cloned its repository. Each has made changes and push tp branch gh-pages. Then all the code has been tested and bug fixed by teamlead. Team worked well. Problems arose with github: push and other. But all members cope with problems. Some parts of site do not match from image.</p>
